## Sharing your Server Info webpage

Homerun Desktop automatically creates a Server Info webpage to help users advertise and share their Minecraft servers. These pages include the server's name, version, address, and downloadable modpack.

To copy the URL for a Server Info webpage, visit the Dashboard page and click the Share Server button (⬆️) on the desired server.
