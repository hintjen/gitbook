# Windows Privilege Escalation Requirement

### Why does Homerun Desktop require admin privileges?

**Homerun Desktop** leverages an optional Windows feature named \[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)] ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)) to manage running your servers.&#x20;

**Homerun Desktop** was built to use the special features of Linux that allow us to make running and backing up your servers as simple as possible, minimizing the amount of software you have to have downloaded on your PC. No more having to install Java!

&#x20;In order to enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature, **Windows requires Administrator privileges** for WSL's installation process.
